using known techniques.


Installation
------------

This package can be installed with pip::

    pip install inteq

and can be upgraded using the ``--upgrade`` flag::

    pip install --upgrade inteq


Supported Equations
-------------------

Volterra
^^^^^^^^

|Volterra plot generated by package|

This package provides the function :func:`inteq.SolveVolterra` which approximates
the solution, g(x), to the Volterra Integral Equation of the first kind:

|vie|

using the method in `Betto and Thomas
(2021) <https://mattwthomas.com/papers/asymmetric-all-pay-contests-with-spillovers/>`__.


Fredholm
^^^^^^^^

|Fredholm plot generated by package|

This package provides the function :func:`inteq.SolveFredholm` which approximates
the solution, g(x), to the Fredholm Integral Equation of the first kind:

|fie|

using the method described in `Twomey
(1963) <https://doi.org/10.1145/321150.321157>`__. It will return a
smooth curve that is an approximate solution. However, it may not be a
good approximate to the true solution.
