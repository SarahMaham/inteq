# Contributing

We love contributions and pull requests from everyone. We are particularly interested in performance improvements, alternative algorithms, and documentation improvements.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/inteq.git

You can install the package in devmode by running:

    pip install -e ./inteq/

Please test any code you write either with the test calls in the [examples directory](examples/) or by writing your own test. This will help us to quickly review your contribution.
