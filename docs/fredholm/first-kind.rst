Solve Fredholm Integral Equations of the First Kind
===================================================

This package provides the function :code:`SolveFredholm` which approximates the solution, g(x), to the Fredholm Integral Equation of the first kind using the method described in `Twomey (1963)`_. It will return a smooth curve that is an approximate solution. However, it may not be a good approximate to the true solution.
